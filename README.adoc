== ref2ris

ref2ris is a small utilty program to convert scientific references from PubMed to RIS format.

The motivation came from assisting someone who lost several months of collected data in Endnote.
The data was available in emails, but only in a scitation format that could not be imported into Endnote directly.

To run:
- place the text files with the citations in the `data` folder

[console]
----
just run data output.ris
----
