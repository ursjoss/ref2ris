== ref2ris

ref2ris is a small utility program to convert scientific references exported from Endnote to RIS format.
The RIS file can be reimported into Endnote.

The motivation came from assisting someone who lost several months of collected data in Endnote.
The data was available in emails, but only in a citation format that could not be imported into Endnote directly.

To run:

Place the text files with the citations in the `data` folder

[console]
----
just run data output.ris
----
